### Initial State:
nums = [0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6]
appendIndex = 0
find = false
k = 0

#### Iteration 1 (i = 0):

nums[0] is 0, not 3. nums remains unchanged.
nums = [0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6]
appendIndex = 1, k = 1

#### Iteration 2 (i = 1):

nums[1] is 0, not 3. nums remains unchanged.
nums = [0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6]
appendIndex = 2, k = 2

#### Iteration 3 (i = 2):

nums[2] is 2, not 3. nums remains unchanged.
nums = [0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6]
appendIndex = 3, k = 3

#### Iteration 4 (i = 3):

nums[3] is 3, which is val. find is set to true.
nums = [0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6]
appendIndex = 3, k = 3 (no change in k)

#### Iteration 5 (i = 4):

nums[4] is 3, which is val. No change in nums.
nums = [0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6]

#### Iteration 6 (i = 5):

nums[5] is 5, not 3. nums[3] is replaced with 5.
nums = [0, 0, 2, 5, 3, 5, 5, 6]
appendIndex = 4, k = 4

#### Iteration 7 (i = 6):
nums[6] is 5, not 3. nums[4] is replaced with 5.
nums = [0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6]
appendIndex = 5, k = 5

##### Iteration 8 (i = 7):
nums[7] is 6, not 3. nums[5] is replaced with 6.
nums = [0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 6, 5, 6]
appendIndex = 6, k = 6

Final State:
nums = [0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 6, 5, 6]
Function returns k = 6
